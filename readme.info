the .env file is never pushed to github
so if you are running code locally, ensure you make a .env file for all
the values that use process.env.variable_name and populate it with same variables
and their respective values.

instead of uploading the env to github, we set the env variables in `config vars` in settings of app on heroku
ensuring no key / private info / password leak happens.

New Deployment is here (not on heroku):
